# BATU-Embedded-Educational-Kits
A set of PCBs and Schmatics designs made by the PCB'n Chill team at Borg Alarab University in Egypt for educational purposes.

## Description:
We call them, experiments, the idea is to have a premade set of hardware that's easy to use and connect, dedicated to a and is built around a specific sensor or module just only to teach/learn how to use that module with ease.

these experiments includes PCB and schematic designs that's optimized for PCB home fabrication (i.e. big soldering pads, thick tracks....) with the soul intended purpose for making them easy to make at home and also for those who want to practice making PCBs at home, essentially the whole thing is so you can just make it yourself and then solder it, and put it together and ghen start programming :).

there are 12 experiments, each with a special use case, they are as follows:

| experiment | Description | Main concept |
| --- | --- | ---|
| 1 | An arduino nano that's connected to a buzzer and also an MQ sensor | using MQ sensors with arduino |
| 2 | An arduino nano that's connected to a 16x2 LCD in 4bit mode, a MOSFET motor driver, a DS18b20 temperature sensor and a joystick module | simple motor speed control with temperature and joystick and display data on LCD|
| 3 | An arduino nano with HC05 bluetooth module and some LEDs, RGB and push button | practice using Bluetooth with arduino nano |
